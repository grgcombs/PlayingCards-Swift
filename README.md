# Playing Cards (Swift)

This project is an exploration of the data structures and syntax of the Swift language.

- The theme of this exploration is a deck of playing cards.  
- It will provide an opportunity to mix enums, structs, classes, extensions and more.

Anyone and everyone is welcome to participate in this exploration.  This is social coding, after all.
